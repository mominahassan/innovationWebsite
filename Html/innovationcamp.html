  <h1> Stay by Save The Children</h1>
  <h2>To prevent dropout</h2>

<h2> Our project </h2>

<h3> The goal of the project</h3>
  <p>The goal of the project is to gain knowledge about why children are absent
    from school, and then use this knowledge to decide where the resources
    sh ould be invested to reduce the absenteeism.  </p>

<h3>Who is this aimed at</h3>
  <p>This project is aimed at developing countries, which are peaceful and
    without conflict. </p>

<h3>How to complete the project</h3>
  <p>We do this using an app, "STAY", that tracks attendance. The app will be used by
    the teachers at school to register the absence. After collecting the
    information, the app sends the data directly to Save the children, when
    the phone is located, or is in an area with coverage. The mobile phones
    will be distributed by Save the children to the teachers, without the
    teachers or the students having to be able to afford to buy a mobile
    phone. </p>

  <p>The app is very clear and easy to use. Pictures of the students will
    be used – but v\will not be forwarded to Save the Children – it will
    remain locally on the phone. The teachers click on the picture of the
    student id he/she is at school, if not, the teacher can press on
    pre-selected reasons for absence or writhe their own text. </p>

  <p>If the student has been away from school for at least 3 days, Save the
    Children will be notified, and contact persons will be sent out to the
    student’s home to find out the reason for the absence.  </p>

<h3>How should we use this information?</h3>
  <p>The data collected from the app; “STAY”, will be used to create a model
    of the physical world with focus on absence. How different variables affect
    each other, and an overview of the reasons for the absence. Using the app,
    the state can access data that can be used to find the relationship between
    different variables and absenteeism. With this, the state and Save the
    Children can cooperate and together come up with effective measures
    aimed at absenteeism. </p>
