<h3 id="goalProject"> The goal of the project</h3>
  <p>The goal of the project is to gain knowledge about why
    children are absent from school, and furthermore use this knowledge to
    find a solution to reduce absenteeism. By collectiong the attendance data,
    we can get a better understanding of where the problem lies, and
    move according to that.This again will help us reach the UNs sustainable
    development goal: "Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and
    promote promote lifelong learning opportunites for all". different reasons
    of students not attending. And then use this knowledge to prevent drop out.
    decide where the resources should be invested to reduce the absenteeism.

  <h3 id="aimed">Who is this aimed at</h3>
    <p>This project is aimed at developing countries, which are peaceful and
      without conflict. </p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h3 id="complete">How to complete the project</h3>
        <p>We do this using an app, "STAY", that tracks attendance. The app will be used by
          the teachers at school to register the absence. After collecting the
          information, the app sends the data directly to Save The children, when
          the phone is located, or is in an area with coverage. The mobile phones
          will be distributed by Save The Children to the teachers, without the
          teachers or the students having to be able to afford to buy a mobile
          phone. </p>

        <p>The app is very clear and easy to use. Pictures of the students will
          be used – but v\will not be forwarded to Save the Children – it will
          remain locally on the phone. The teachers click on the picture of the
          student id he/she is at school, if not, the teacher can press on
          pre-selected reasons for absence or writhe their own text. </p>

        <p>If the student has been away from school for at least 3 days, Save The
          Children will be notified, and contact persons will be sent out to the
          student’s home to find out the reason for the absence.  </p>

      <h3 id="information">How should we use this information</h3>

        <p>The data collected from the app; “STAY”, will be used to create a model
          of the physical world with focus on absence. About how different variables
          affect each other, and an overview of the reasons for the absence. Using
          the app, the state can access data that can be used to find the relationship
          between different variables and absenteeism. With this, the state and Save The
          Children can cooperate and together come up with effective measures
          aimed at absenteeism. </p>
